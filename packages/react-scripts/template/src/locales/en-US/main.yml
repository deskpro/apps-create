# This is a language file. Every key here is a phrase that
# can be translated into other languages.
#
# To use a phrase in your code, use the i18n helper available
# from dpapp like this:
#    <p>{dpapp.i18n.t("hello_name", { name: "John" )}</p>
# Or the shorter alias 't':
#    <p>{dpapp.t("hello_name", { name: "John" )}</p>
# Or finally, you can use the Phrase component:
#    import { Phrase } from '@deskpro/apps-components/DeskproApp';
#    <Phrase id="hello_name" name="John" />
#
# All apps MUST include an `en-US` or `en` locale.
#
# Refer to the manual for more information about translation and I18n:
# https://deskpro.gitbook.io/deskpro-apps/i18n/translation-and-i18n

# Here's an example phrase using a variable like demonstrated above:
hello_name: "Hello, {{name}}!"

# You can organise phrases intro structures. When you do this, you
# refer to the phrase by the full ID, using dots to denote hierarchy.
# For example: <Phrase id="welcome.again" />
welcome:
  back: "Welcome back"
  again: "Hello again"
